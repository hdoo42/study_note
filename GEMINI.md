## Post-Documentation Protocol

Whenever you (Gemini) create a new study note, document, or explanation file for the user, you MUST follow this step immediately after confirming the file creation:

### 🎯 Quiz Time
Always generate a brief quiz to verify the user's understanding of the created material.

**Quiz Guidelines:**
1.  **Scope**: Based strictly on the content just generated.
2.  **Format**: 3 to 5 questions (Multiple choice or Short answer).
3.  **Goal**: To reinforce key concepts and ensure retention.
4.  **Interaction**: Ask the user to attempt the quiz, then provide the correct answers and explanations after they respond.

**Example Workflow:**
1.  User asks for a document about "Topic X".
2.  Gemini creates "Topic X.md".
3.  Gemini confirms creation.
4.  Gemini immediately presents: "Now that we've covered Topic X, here is a quick quiz to test your knowledge..."
